Here i will be posting the commands to run the programs related to AI

The commands are as follows:

1 - To play the PACMAN game write the command in your terminal: python pacman.py

2 - To see the Searching Algorithm to work write the following commands after the python keyword into the terminal:
	-python pacman.py -l <mazename> -p SearchAgent -a fn=<searching function>
	
	replace the following with any of the below keyword:
	<mazename> - tinyMaze 
		   - mediumMaze
		   - bigMaze
		
	<searchingfunction> - dfs (depth first search)
			    - bfs (breath first search)
			    - ucs (uniform cost search)
			    - aster (A* Search)
			   
			   
	example: 
	-python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs
	
	-while using 'astar' write like this to give it a heuristic function:
	 python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic 
	

 THE SEARCHING PART CAN BE SEEN IN THE search.py python file file
